# C-Sharp-File-Sim

The following c# code creates a gui based virtual file system based on 3 physical drives. The simulator starts out with all the directories closed.


Clicking on any of the directories in the physical drives opens those sub-directories and finally any files stored in those directories.

Clicking on any directory in the virtual file system also opens any sub-directories and files but also gives a preview of those files.

The box at the bottom of the File sim allows new files to be added to the current directory that is open by typing in the new file name and clicking the + symbol next to the box.


Directories and files can be deleted by clicking the Delete Selected box at the bottom after highlighting the selected file or directory.
